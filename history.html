                    Brukner Nature Center

                    opened to the public in

                    1974 and is the vision of

                    Clayton J. Brukner, local

                    philanthropist who was

                    born December 18, 1896

                    in Ravenna, Nebraska.

                    With high school chum

                    and business partner, E.J.

                    "Sam" Junkin, he brought the Weaver Aircraft Company to Troy, Ohio in 1923. The company name was
                    eventually changed to the WACO Aircraft Company, which became the most successful civil aircraft
                    manufacturer of the pre World War II era.



                    Clayton Brukner was an entrepreneur, mechanical genius, and community philanthropist. He had a great
                    love for nature and in 1933 bought 146 acres of land along the Stillwater River, not known for its
                    productivity, but rather for its natural beauty. In 1967 he unveiled his plans to build a nature
                    center on this site and in May of 1974, Brukner Nature Center opened to the public. The 165 acre
                    preserve is traversed by 6 miles of hiking trails, Interpretive Building and the 1804 Iddings Log
                    House.</p>

                <p>Brukner Nature Center is a privately funded, nonprofit organization promoting the appreciation and
                    understanding of wildlife conservation through preservation, education, and rehabilitation. The 1804
                    Iddings log house was renovated in 1980 and again in 2006. It is on the registry of Historic Places
                    as the oldest structure on its original site in Miami County!



                    Under the guidance of our first Directors, Bob & Joan Heidelberg, we grew to a 165-acre preserve
                    with services reaching 21 counties. Today, we annually touch over 45,000 people with our innovative
                    hands-on wildlife programming. Each year over 120,000 visitors enjoy our public events, take a
                    stroll in the woods or visit with our wildlife ambassadors.



                    In 1998 an addition to Interpretive Building doubled the size and provides handicap accessibility to
                    all three floors including our popular Tree-top Bird Vista. In May of 2011, we renovated the
                    interpretive area in our downstairs wildlife exhibits. Our main lobby renovation was completed in
                    May 2016 and we just finished our wildlife rehabilitation quarantine building in 2019! Thank you to
                    all of our supporters who have helped us reach all of our goals!</p>


                <h3>Iddings Log House: </h3>
                <p>An integral part of Brukner Nature Center’s interpretive programming, the 1804 Iddings Log House also
                    holds an important place in the history of Miami County. The Iddings family is originally descended
                    from the Norsemen and came to America from Radnorshire, Wales in 1683. Richard Iddings and his wife,
                    Sarah Thomas, arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and settled in Nantmeal Township, Pennsylvania,
                    between the forks of the Brandywine River and French Creek, very near a little place called Valley
                    Forge. Richard and Sarah Iddings were the grandparents of two famous figures in Ohio history,
                    General “Mad” Anthony Wayne and Benjamin Iddings.



                    Benjamin Iddings married Phebe Wilkinson in 1775, in Pennsylvania. Their children, listed in the
                    Quaker Monthly Meeting records were Rachel, Ruth, Talbot, Joseph, Mary, Benjamin Jr., Phoebe,
                    William, Millie and Hannah. The Iddings were a prominent and very active family in the Quaker
                    community. They began their life on the road in 1779, moving frequently to escape the fighting in
                    the area. They settled in Greene County, Tennessee in 1795. Here they helped found the New Hope
                    Monthly Meeting, were Benjamin was appointed recorder in 1796 and was an Elder.



                    Following the Treaty of Greeneville in 1795, the Ohio territory was opened for settlement. Benjamin,
                    perhaps because of his famous cousin’s experience in the area, made an exploratory trip up the
                    Stillwater River into what is now Newton Township. He moved his family to Miami County, acquiring a
                    patent on 160 acres on SE 1/4 Sec. 33-7-5E. Here, in 1804, Benjamin constructed the log house on
                    what is now Brukner Nature Center property. Benjamin and Phoebe lived here with six of their ten
                    children, as Rachel had passed away and Ruth, Talbot & Joseph were married and on their own.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, Benjamin built his house on the property of his neighbor, Benjamin Pearson and later
                    paid him the sum of $63.11 ½ for an additional four acres upon which his house was built. Although
                    this sounds strange for modern times, it was not unusual for property lines to be mistaken in the
                    wilderness of 1800 Ohio. Phoebe died in 1818 and in 1822, Benjamin married his widowed neighbor,
                    Ruth Pierce. Benjamin died in 1826, and both he and Ruth are buried in Old Union Cemetery, on
                    Horseshoe Bend Road.



                    Through extensive research, the underlying historical value of the structure itself was realized,
                    not only for its handsome construction but for the significant family history. In 1976, the 1804
                    Iddings Log House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and a successful
                    restoration was completed in 1981. Through its doors have passed many visitors stepping back in
                    time, from Iddings relatives looking for a link to the past to children too numerous to count making
                    memories to last a lifetime.</p>
