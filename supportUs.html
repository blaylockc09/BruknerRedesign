						<h3>Pledge the Big Sit</h3>
						<p>
							Join the BNC Bird Club as we sit in a 17 foot circle in the BNC parking lot and tally the
							bird species seen or heard from that small island! This fundraiser supports our wildlife
							education programs and we are currently accepting pledges for each species seen (hint, hint:
							our record is 54 species!) This annual fundraising event is held each May and our goal is to
							encourage others (especially kids) to experience the fun of this lifelong hobby of
							birdwatching.
							<br>
							<b>Want to support us and make a pledge?</b>

							It's simple, just e-mail us with your pledge per species amount and we'll let you know how
							many different species we see that day!
							<br>
							<b>Did you know that we have our very own Young Birder’s Club?</b>
							<br>
							So bring the kids, come see our resident bald eagle, learn the call of the eastern phoebe,
							watch a bird build a nest, then make a pledge for each species we record and make a
							difference for wildlife education!

							We need your support!</p>
